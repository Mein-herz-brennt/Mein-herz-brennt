## 🚀 About Me

I'm a Master's student in **Computational Mathematics** at Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, with a Bachelor's in **Mathematics Education**. Passionate about data-driven insights, elegant models, and building tools that make numbers speak volumes.

Whether it's diving deep into statistical theory or visualizing complex datasets, I thrive at the intersection of **math, data, and code**.
